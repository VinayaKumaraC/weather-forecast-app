🌦️ Weather Forecast Application
📌 Project Overview

The Weather Forecast Application is a responsive web application that displays real-time weather information using a public weather API.
It allows users to search weather details by city name or by using their current location.
The application is designed with a clean and user-friendly interface using Tailwind CSS and JavaScript.

This project was developed as part of an academic assignment to understand API integration, DOM manipulation, and responsive UI design.

📚 Learning Outcomes

By building this project, I learned:

How to integrate third-party APIs using JavaScript

How to work with asynchronous data using fetch

DOM manipulation and event handling

Using localStorage to store recent searches

Creating responsive layouts using Tailwind CSS

Handling user input validation and API errors gracefully


📎 Note

Node modules are not included, as this project does not require a build setup.

All features are implemented using vanilla JavaScript and Tailwind CDN.
