🌦️ Weather Forecast Application
📌 Project Overview
The Weather Forecast Application is a responsive web application that displays real-time weather information using a public weather API.
It allows users to search weather details by city name or by using their current location through the Geolocation API.

The application is designed with a clean and user-friendly interface using Tailwind CSS and JavaScript, focusing on usability, responsiveness, and real-world API integration.

This project was developed as part of an academic assignment to strengthen understanding of API usage, DOM manipulation, and responsive web design.

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML – Structure of the application

Tailwind CSS – Styling and responsive layout

JavaScript – Logic, API calls, and interactivity

OpenWeatherMap API – Weather data source


🚀 How to Run the Project

Download or clone this repository.

Open the project folder in VS Code.

Open script.js and replace the API key:

const API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";

Open index.html in any modern web browser.

Enter a city name or use the “Use My Location” button to view weather data.


📚 Learning Outcomes

By building this project, I learned:

How to integrate third-party APIs using JavaScript

How to work with asynchronous data using fetch

DOM manipulation and event handling

Using localStorage to store recent user data

Creating responsive layouts using Tailwind CSS

Handling user input validation and API errors gracefully


📎 Note

This project does not require a build setup, so no node_modules folder is included.

All features are implemented using vanilla JavaScript and Tailwind CSS CDN.
